# we want output: Line A \n Line B
print("Line A \\n Line B")  #we will use double  backslash n which will print it as it is.
#same we will do in all case like \\t, etc

# output : \" \'
print (" \\\" \\\' ")
# \' = ' ...(a)
# \\ = \ ...(b)
# now if we want output simply know by adding a+b
# \\\' = \'
